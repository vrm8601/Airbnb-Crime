I didn't have to live out of my rucksack for ten days which made me already feel comfortable.\\r\\nThe appartment is situated right at the north end of Central Park in Harlem and very close to different subway stations. I could either start my day with a morning stroll through the park and into the Upper West or Upper East Side, or catch the subway to get to Midtown, South Manhattan or Brooklyn in no time. So from a geographical vantage point the appartment is perfectly situated to discover the city.\\r\\nBut apart from all these facts it was above all Stephanie with her warm and welcoming nature that really made me feel comfortable during these days. It is very nice to come \"home\" in the evening, tired after a long day's strolling around, and end the day with a little chit-chat about one's experiences before falling into bed and, with thumb-in-mouth, sleep blissfully through till the next morning.\\r\\nNYC, I will be back, and I know where I'll be staying!

I had no problem finding my way from the subway at Central Park North and I never felt unsafe walking from the subway to the apartment (a 5 min walk)When I got to the apartment complex at 7th ave (Chez Chic)there was no elevator but there was a really friendly neighbor that helped me carry my luggage up the stairs. I met Stephanie's very nice husband and her two beautiful children and they were never a bother! And she even let me use her laptop so I can check my email and keep in touch with my family.\\r\\nI was free to come and go anytime I wanted to and having my own bathroom was a bonus! The bed was REALLY comfy, the air conditioning was a relief and the closet was spacious.\\r\\n Not too far up the street there was a 24 hour market that was awesome with a lot of great stuff to choose from so I was always able to make my own breakfast, lunch and dinner!! Going to and from uptown to midtown Manhattan was very easy and convenient with the subways running 24 hours (only a 25 min ride to Time Square) and there was always people around so you never felt alone!!\\r\\nOver all I really enjoyed my stay at Chez Chic and New York was a great city! I recommend any place Stephanie has available!! \\r\\nEnjoy your time in New York!</td>\n",

Trust me!\\r\\n\\r\\nSome advice if you arrive at JFK and you don't want to spend too much money in transportation:Take the airtrain to Jamaica Station and then take the A line(subway)to Manhattan.Change at 42th Street Times Square to C line uptown and stop at 110th Street Cathedral Pkwy.

The house was very neat, stocked and clean; just like being at home! Towels, toiletries, etc! We did not have to want for anything! Jesus is also a professional photographer who does phenomenal work. We even booked him to take some amazing photos of us! Not only did my husband and I enjoy our 11 year anniversary but Jesus captured some incredible moments on camera which will last lifetime!

She was awesome with us, it was a pleasure to stay in her appt. she's french, so last word ...\\r\\nMerci encore stephanie pour ton hospitalitÃ©. On a passÃ© un super sÃ©jour avec toi. TrÃ¨s disponible pour nous avec pleins de conseils, je vous recommande particulierement cette adresse qui plus est pour un prix raisonnable. Le metro est juste a 1 bloc de l'appartement et la ligne 1-2-3 est la plus centrale et la plus pratique de NYC. son quartier est vraiment tres sympa en plus !!!

       "2515      I just got back from a trip to NYC during which I stayed at Stephanie's appartment. The bedroom and private bathroom that comes with it were both kept very clean and are spacious so that I could unpack my stuff and put my clothes away in the closet. I didn't have to live out of my rucksack for ten days which made me already feel comfortable.\\r\\nThe appartment is situated right at the north end of Central Park in Harlem and very close to different subway stations. I could either start my day with a morning stroll through the park and into the Upper West or Upper East Side, or catch the subway to get to Midtown, South Manhattan or Brooklyn in no time. So from a geographical vantage point the appartment is perfectly situated to discover the city.\\r\\nBut apart from all these facts it was above all Stephanie with her warm and welcoming nature that really made me feel comfortable during these days. It is very nice to come \"home\" in the evening, tired after a long day's strolling around, and end the day with a little chit-chat about one's experiences before falling into bed and, with thumb-in-mouth, sleep blissfully through till the next morning.\\r\\nNYC, I will be back, and I know where I'll be staying! Thank you, Stephanie!!!                                                          \n",
       "2515      Stephanie's offered all the most important things: a warm welcome into a comfortable home; a comfortable bed in a quiet room; fresh & clean towels & blankets; and easy access to Manhattan.

       "2515      When I first arrived at Stephanie's, she was very welcoming! I had no problem finding my way from the subway at Central Park North and I never felt unsafe walking from the subway to the apartment (a 5 min walk)When I got to the apartment complex at 7th ave (Chez Chic)there was no elevator but there was a really friendly neighbor that helped me carry my luggage up the stairs. I met Stephanie's very nice husband and her two beautiful children and they were never a bother! And she even let me use her laptop so I can check my email and keep in touch with my family.\\r\\nI was free to come and go anytime I wanted to and having my own bathroom was a bonus! The bed was REALLY comfy, the air conditioning was a relief and the closet was spacious.\\r\\n Not too far up the street there was a 24 hour market that was awesome with a lot of great stuff to choose from so I was always able to make my own breakfast, lunch and dinner!! Going to and from uptown to midtown Manhattan was very easy and convenient with the subways running 24 hours (only a 25 min ride to Time Square) and there was always people around so you never felt alone!!\\r\\nOver all I really enjoyed my stay at Chez Chic and New York was a great city! I recommend any place Stephanie has available!! \\r\\nEnjoy your time in New York!   \n",

She even helped my son find the best and safest route to an event he had planned on attending with his college friends.  Overall very professional and accommodating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "2515      What a great location and welcome from Stephanie and her family! We arrived late on Friday night and Stephanie was there to welcome us. She provided excellent local information and also directions to downtown, which proved vital on the day of the marathon. The room was excellent and the bed was very comfortable, was also great to come home to a warm house very night! Living with Stephanie and her family added to our New York experience and we would recommend it to anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Stpehanie!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "2515      Stephanie and her family are warm and welcoming, offering assistance and advice without being at all intrusive. The place is clean, in a dynamic neighborhood and close to central park and transport. People who have difficulties with stairs might wish to avoid this place as there are five floors to be negotiated to reach the front door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "2515      It was the 1st time my boyfriend and I were going to NYC!Our stay at stephanie's was just amazing!!!!We arrived late in the evening but stephanie was there to welcome us and give us lots of useful tips about New York!Her family is so friendly and her little son is so funny! The neighborhood is really pleasant!Her neighbors called her as we didn't have any service on our phone ! The apartment is very close to Central Park North and Harlem Meer (just a few steps to get there!)and also close to subway and bus station!\\r\\nShe always asked us if we needed anything!\\r\\nYou can go there with complete confidence you won't be disappointed! Trust me!\\r\\n\\r\\nSome advice if you arrive at JFK and you don't want to spend too much money in transportation:Take the airtrain to Jamaica Station and then take the A line(subway)to Manhattan.Change at 42th Street Times Square to C line uptown and stop at 110th Street Cathedral Pkwy. Then you'll just have to walk 5 or 10 minutes and you'll be there!\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "2515      My husband and i stayed with Stepanie and her family at the Chez Chic Private Room for 4 nights.  The accomodations were wonderful.  Stephanie was a fabulous hostess.  We had so much privacy that it felt like we were in our own apartment most of the time.  Stephanie was great with giving us directions and recommendations of places to eat and visit.  Everything was absolutely wonderful.  The room is very quiet and clean and comfortable.  Everything is exactly as Stephanie advertises.  My husband and I left the city with a new found appreciation for Harlem thanks to Stephanie and her family.  We absolutely cannot wait to stay with Stephanie again.  We would recommend her to anyone coming to NYC!!!!!! We already have multiple times.

       "21067832  The building was filled with character, and the apartment itself was clean, stylish, and cozy. It was located in a quiet, residential neighborhood, but was in walking distance to many public transportation stops, which made planning our NY visit much easier. Seth was an excellent communicator and gave us fantastic recommendations for local eats (we'll never forget that gelato). My friend and I both adored our stay at Seth's place and would highly recommend!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "21098282  This place definitely exceeded my expectations! The bedroom is super clean; the bed is very comfortable; the bathroom is sparkling clean as well. The apartment is very quiet. The owner responded promptly. She is very friendly and nice although we checked in very late.  The location is superb! We had a nice walk in the park and along the east river. It's close to the Metropolitan Museum, central park, and the Guggenheim Museum and is very convenient to go to other places as well.

       "21107446  This was our 11 year anniversary and our very first experience! I was very leery of the idea of staying in someone else's home until my very first interaction with Christian and his larger than life room mate Jesus! The house was very neat, stocked and clean; just like being at home! Towels, toiletries, etc! We did not have to want for anything! Jesus is also a professional photographer who does phenomenal work. We even booked him to take some amazing photos of us! Not only did my husband and I enjoy our 11 year anniversary but Jesus captured some incredible moments on camera which will last lifetime! I will definitely book with them again and again when visiting NYC!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "21120942  Oliver's apartment was everything I hoped for and more. Spacious and stylish, I was beyond comfortable the entire time. Oliver and his partner were very communicative and easy to work with - anytime I had a question, they always had a response for me right away. The washer and dryer were incredibly convenient, and I loved hanging out in the gym and on the deck. I would give this place 6 stars out of 5 and will definitely stay here again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "21120942  What a find! Oliver's apartment is an absolute delight. Even with all the awesome extras (washer and dryer in NYC?

       "21126158  I highly recommend this apartment right in the heart of midtown.  Not only did this apartment live up to our high expectations but it was in a good location.

       "21154302  This place was totally awesome! It felt just like home! The scented candles just made it feel so much like home. \\nThe place was beautiful! Also the fact that they had complimentary drinks for me is one of the sweetest things ever. For my first AirBNB experience, it's a 10 all around! I'm so happy to have met this beautiful family!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "21154538  Daniel was a great host. He was flexible with our late check in time, and let us keep our luggage in the house past check out time. He was easy to communicate with, and the place was great with an awesome view!

However, it does get the point across that there appears to be hardly any negative reviews compared to positive ones. In the next graph we plot the two separately, so we can see the distributions of the negative reviews as well as the positive reviews for each borough. It is important to note that the range of the y-axis scales are very different."
