Background:
    Airbnb has become very popular over the past decade and is useful for people traveling for work or vacation. NYC is a busy area with       limited housing and many people are taking advantage of and extra space they have to make some money. For this project, we plan to         investigate:
    
1. Is there a difference in the cost, amount of bookings, and ratings for different areas? Do additional research to learn why.
2. Do factors such as number of minimum nights, cancellation policy, instant bookable, and house rules affect the popularity of an Airbnb?
3. How important are reviews and how much do they affect whether or not an Airbnb gets booked?
4. Do amenities, access (entire apartment vs private room), room type (private vs shared), transit, or number of guests significantly impact whether or not an Airbnb is booked?
5. Visualize the data on a map - what are the most popular areas and is there an underlying reason for them that we can find? For example, are they close to popular sites such as the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, or the Empire State Building?
6. What hosts are the busiest? Do additional research to find out why.
7. Are there times when no Airbnbs are available or extremely limited and on what dates does this occur?
8. How does the amount of crime in an area affect the popularity and price of an Airbnb?
